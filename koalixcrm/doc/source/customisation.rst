Customising koalixcrm
=====================

There are several ways in which to customise koalixcrm, depending on your requirements.

In all cases contributions can be submitted back to koalixcrm by opening an
issue in `GitHub <https://github.com/scaphilo/koalixcrm>`_ - see our
repositories CONTRIBUTING.md file for more information.


Translators
-----------

The Application itself
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To translate the application itself the only thing you have to do is to install koalixcrm on a Linux or Windows Machine. Please excuse that I can't give you good advice in how to install
the software under Windows I simply do not have the nerves to play around with the Windows powershell or the cmd :-).  

::

  cd /var/www/koalixcrm/crm
  django-admin makemessages -l yourlanguage

this creates a new directory in the folder called ``/var/www/koalixcrm/crm/locale/yourlanguage/LC_MESSAGES/``
in this directory you will find one file called django.po -  edit this file in the following way:

Lets say you want to translate koalixcrm to French. Find all msgid's in django.po and look at the english text.
The msgstr following a msgid will be the place you write your translation.

Example::
  msgid "phonenumber"
  msgstr "phonenumber"

Adjust it to the following::
  msgid "phonenumber"
  msgstr "nombre de telefon"

After you finised translating the whole file test your translation by compiling it. 

::

  django-admin compilemessages 

After this you are able to use your translation. Sometimes seting your language in ``/var/www/koalixcrm/settings.py`` is required.
Go on with your translation for accounting and for djangouserextention folders.
As soon as you finish this part you will be able to work with koalixcrm in your own language. But there is still something missing: the templatefiles for pdf creation have to be translated as well.



Custom template files for PDF creation
--------------------------------------

For translators or localisers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To translate the templatefiles for PDF creation you will have to adjust the templatefiles in the ``/var/www/koalixcrm/templatefiles`` folder. There you will find a folder for every language code that is already 
translated by the koalixcrm comunity or me. To add your own language type the following::

  cp -R en yourlanguage

now open yourlanguage folder and adjust the content of every xml file.

Site specific customisation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As with customisations for translators, the focus for site specific
customisation is koalixcrm's install path/templatefiles/yourlanguage. Entries
in the yourlanguage folder can be edited as you wish, to produce documents with
your letterhead, contact details or other modifications.



Modders
------- 

There is currently no API available ... I'm going to start with that as soon as possible but certainly after I finish
the rest of the user documentation.
